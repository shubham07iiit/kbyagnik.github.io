Deals of the Day is the program run by Booking.com to select parterns based on their attributes such as ratings, reviews, Bookings per day... This Program provides ranking boost to selective parterns on the search results page which inturn drives more Bookings.

* Proposed an algorithm to combine various attributes of parterns to the single number which would decide their eligibility for the DOTD. 
* Wrote an Oozie Job triggering Pyspark script on hadoop clusters to run the above algorithm.
* Exported the final ranking to MySQL database, which would be used by client facing API's.
