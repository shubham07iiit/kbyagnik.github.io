Working on sponsored search advertisements on the BingAds platform, under the guidance of [Jitendra Ajmera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jitendra-ajmera-38b5ab3/), I have accomplished tasks like:

* Using stochastic modelling techniques for experimentation to see if the accuracy for predicted performance indicators can be improved.
* Improving the prediction for advertiser parameters and incentivising advertisers to reveal true value for the click.
* Large scale data storage optimizations to reduce the memory by >30% to decrease the cost-to-serve.
* Deciding optimum parameters for maximum revenue generation subject to market constraints and modelling better pricing rules.
* Improving the clustering mechanism to create better query distribution and automating its workflow.
