Worked on aggregating drives locations to determine the location in which the user drives most of the time to personalize his experience when he adds drive manually.

* Data Analytics Job aggregates data on AWS.
* The aggregation dumps data on S3 in text files.
* Exposed API's to fetch the most frequent location for each user.
* When user add drives manually they see map loaded with relevant location personalized to their use case.
