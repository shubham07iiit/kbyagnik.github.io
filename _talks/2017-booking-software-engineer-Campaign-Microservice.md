I worked in the Deals team in Booking.com. As Deals team, we launched several campaigns thorugh out the year, everywhere on the globe. I scaled the system to launch campaigns in few minutes with several configurations settigns including but not limited to specific_regions/ festivals/ discounts etc.

* Designed and proposed the architecture of scalable and independent microservice.
* REST API's to launch, edit and stop the campaign.
* A/B Testing on Booking.com deals page, to monitor the impact of a campaign.
* Alerting/ Monitoring and health check via Grafana Dashboard.
