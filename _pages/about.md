I'm Shubham Singhal, currently working as a Software Developer at Microsoft India, Bangalore. Prior to Microsoft I worked at Adobe Systems, India, Noida. In total I have 4 years of working experience.

Currently I am developing a microservice which aggregates data we collect via product [MileIq](https://www.mileiq.com/) and generate reports to send to customers for filing tax.

I'm passionate about Human Computer Interaction, Machine Learning and Data Science. I am working on quantifying usability of the product, understanding users's interests and personalizing their experience on every feature they use.
