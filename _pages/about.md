I'm Shubham Singhal, currently working as a Software Developer at Microsoft India, Bangalore. Prior to Microsoft I worked at Adobe Systems, India, Noida. In total I have 4 years of working experience.

Currently, I am working on a product name [MileIq](https://www.mileiq.com/). I am working on reporting microservice, which runs on Python3 (Django), Azure SQL Server, Redis Queue and hosted on Azure container services using Docker and Kubernetes.

I'm passionate about Human Computer Interaction, Machine Learning and Data Science. In my free time I love to work on studying usability metrics and algorithms to quantifying usability of the product, understanding users's interests and personalizing their experience on every feature they use.
