excerpt: "Eye Tracking for Natural Language Processing: Human Eye Movements patterns have been studied by psycholinguistics and computer linguistics to understand the cognitive aspects of natural language processing. For this, they often record the eye movements and find common trends that reflect the linguistic subtleties of text and are not prone to subjectivity. Thus it is required to engender method to find consensus eye movements."

* Analyzed people behavior of carrying NLP tasks and increasing efficiency of NLP algorithms using Eye Tracking
* Given a Sentence S and N participants for conducting NLP Experiment, our objective is to find the Consensus Eye Movements, using Eye Movements of N participants recorded through eye tracker.
* Finding the Areas of Interest (AOIs) that are common to all the participants
* Clustering of Fixations to Determine Areas of Interests
* Finding an appropriate sequence of the Areas of Interest to synthesize the consensus scanpath
* Getting AOIâ€™s and combining them to generate Consensus sequence is done by K-mean clustering, Bayesian Network and Viterbi Algorithm
