* I selected 10 batch mates at random.
* Clicked 10 pictures of each of them in different orientation.
* Used 6 for training and 4 for testing.
* Extracted features using Principal Component Analysis.
* In the first run matched simply by distance based algorithms.
* Later trained ANN model to recognize them.
