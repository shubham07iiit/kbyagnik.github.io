*Collected over 5000 images from 7 different categories. Categories were:
1. Flowers
2. Aeroplanes
3. Homes and Buildings
4. Birds
5. Guitars
6. Insects
7. Interiors

* 5000 images were classified in 80%, 20% ratio. 80% images were used to train the model and 20% for testing.
* Each category had few subcategories which were trained separately by 7 different models.
* Each layer of ANN was parallelized using Parallel Patterns Library (PPL).
* Artificial Neural Network was coded in C++.
* We achieved 98.6% accuracy.
